Yo, so I finally released some music!! Last couple of years have been a crazy ride. This album is the outcome of it and it is also a tribute to our lost friend Leo Carolan, who's memory we will keep alive forever. I couldn't have done it without Tomasz Pawlicki and his clockwork drums, Max Cabbage aka Mr.Soden and his ridiculous bass lines, Jack O'Máille & @Bryan Jardim Fleming and their funky guitars, Karima Dillon El-Toukhy and her cheeky flute, and of course Tony Halik aka DjFunkTom the master of the turntables. Additional thanks to Temper-Mental MissElayneous, Eoin Malin, Sam Farrar & Eimear Gildea for lending their voices. And to Skip for lending the tape delay (game changer). I'm very lucky be able to work with people way more talented than myself. 
I've never been more proud of anything.
Thank you all so much.
